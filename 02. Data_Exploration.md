#### Data Exploration

 1. "Daily Activity Merged" includes daily activity logs for 33 users.  This set compiles 3 activity types, their distance, minutes spent performing them. The 3 activity types are: light, fairly and very active. The distance columns are not defined but based on the step data provided resemble Kilometers. Minutes spent without activity are categorized as sedentary time. This set also includes steps taken and calories burned. 

 2. "Hourly Steps Merged" includes the same 33 user Ids, but expands the daily steps into hourly increments categorized in 24 hour format. As mentioned previously, there was a variance between the total steps calculated in this set compared to the daily logs in the "Daily Activity Merged" set above, likely due to device usage. Because of this variance I used the step information in this set only for my analysis on steps per time of day.

 3. "Sleep Day Merged", details 24 user Ids, their minutes asleep, and minutes in bed but not asleep. [Fitbit’s website](https://help.fitbit.com/articles/en_US/Help_article/2163.htm) states that the watch tracks heart rate and movement patterns to determine if the user is awake or asleep. Fitbit also states that the “Awake” category includes when users are somewhere in a sleep cycle but are restless and wake up briefly. 

 4. "Weight Log Info Merged", includes only 8 user Ids, weight (kg and lbs), BMI, and whether the data was logged manually or automatically. The set also included a “Fat” column but was only utilized in 2 cells.
